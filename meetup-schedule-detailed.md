# Quorum meetup schedule and calendar (detailed)

Meetups are held quarterly. On a rotating basis, a different meetup will be
responsible for the quarterly super meetup.

If it is safe to do so (cornavirus notwithstanding), individual chapters
can still meet in person during the off months for social networking or for
their own local educational presentation events. Individual chapters are also
welcome to organize in-person events to view the super meetups.

Our quarters will consist of the following schedule:

  | Q  | Months     |
  | -- | ---------- |
  | Q1 | Jan-Mar    |
  | Q2 | April-June |
  | Q3 | July-Sept  |
  | Q4 | Oct-Dec    |

As a general rule, East Coast meetups will occur the first month of the quarter
and West Coast meetups will occur in the second month of the quarter. The off
months for each quarter can act as a backup for meetings if needed. We'll have a
planning meeting the month before each meetup to plan the logistics for the
upcoming quarter.

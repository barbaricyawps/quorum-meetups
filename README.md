# Write the Docs Quorum

This is the place to learn about the Write the Docs Quorum pilot program.


## What is Write the Docs Quorum?

The Quorum program brings together various Write the Docs meetup chapters that
are in a common time zone to provide quarterly "super" meetups over Zoom
throughout the year. These are quarterly regional remote meetups, hence the
name: QRRM.

Write the Docs is running the Quorum program as a pilot in the U.S. East Coast
region for 2021. If the pilot program is successful and there is sufficient
interest, Quorum might expand to the U.S. West Coast and EMEA regions later
in 2021 or 2022.

The following U.S. East Coast and Central meetups are currently participating in
Quorum:

- Atlanta, GA
- Austin, TX
- Boston, MA
- Detroit, MI/Windsor, CAN
- Durham, NC
- Florida
- Philadelphia, PA

Quorum pilot coordinator for 2021:

## Meetup schedules

Meetups are held quarterly. On a rotating basis, a different meetup will be
responsible for the quarterly super meetup.

If it is safe to do so (cornavirus notwithstanding), individual chapters
can still meet in person during the off months for social networking or for
their own local educational presentation events. Individual chapters are also
welcome to organize in-person events to view the super meetups.

Our quarters will consist of the following schedule:

  | Q  | Months    |
  | -- | --------- |
  | Q1 | Feb-April |
  | Q2 | May-July  |
  | Q3 | Aug-Oct   |
  | Q4 | Nov-Jan   |

  As a general rule, meetups will occur the first month of the quarter with the
  second month of the quarter acting as a backup if needed. We'll have a
  planning meeting the last quarter of the month to plan the logistics for the
  upcoming quarter.

  We'll offer speakers Monday through Thursday as the range of acceptable days
  of the week for presentations.

## Meeting agenda and times

Our meetings will last an hour and will follow this agenda and time structure:

- **7:00 to 7:10 - Social networking time** - For the first 10 minutes, remote
  attendees join the Zoom call and socialize.
- **7:10 to 7:15 - Announcements** - The emcee will give announcements and
  introduce the speaker.
- **7:15 to 7:45 - Presentation and Q&A** - The speaker can spend about 30-45
  minutes giving a presentation, which includes the Q&A portion. The Q&A can
  expand to fill the time if the presentation is short.
- **7:45 to 8:00 - Breakout rooms by meetup** - We'll use Zoom breakout rooms
  to have people meet with their individual meetup organizers to say hi to
  other people in their meetup. Organizers can use that time to talk about
  job openings, talk about future meetups, and socialize.

See [Meeting agenda (detailed)](meeting-agenda-detailed.md) more detailed
meeting instructions. See also: [Emcee script](emcee-script.md).


## Responsibilities of participating meetups

Participating meetup organizers agree to:

- Find a speaker for one approximately one event on a rotating basis.
- Either emcee or find an emcee for their event.
- Help promote each regional event with their meetup members--not just the month
  that they arranged the speaker.
- Attend as many regional super meetups for your region as possible.
- (Optional): It could help to have 1-2 core team members who can assist in
  coordinating the Zoom calls and communicating with meetup organizers.


## Advantages of participating

Participating in WTD Quorum has many potential advantages:

- **Sharing the workload** - Volunteering as a WTD meetup organizer can involve
  a lot of work depending on how much support you have from the members and
  other organizers in your chapter. Quorum super meetups can take some of the
  pressure off by reducing the number of meetups you have to coordinate on your
  own.
- **Attracting high quality speakers** - Because remote attendance increases
  audience sizes, high quality speakers can be better guaranteed they will have
  a good audience. Remote meetups can also attract high quality speakers by
  allowing them to present from their preferred location, reducing the burden on
  their time.
- **Expanding access to high quality content** - Some meetups have a greater
  pool of potential high quality presenters to draw on than others simply
  because of geographic density. Remote meetups allow WTD members from less
  dense geographic regions to have access to good content without needing to
  attend in person.
- **Reducing the need for venues or sponsors** - In-person meetings usually need
  a venue or sponsor to be successful. Coordinating sponsors and venues is
  frequently challenging for meetup organizers. Remote meetups donâ€™t have these
  needs.


## How to participate in Quorum

We can launch a new quorum in a region if we have at least 4 or more meetups
in a given region that are interested in participating.

To join the discussion, join the [Write the Docs Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/)
and add yourself to the `#meetup-organizers-quorum`. You can also send a direct
message on Slack to Alyssa Rock, the current Quorum coordinator.

We also have a mailing list on [wtd-quorum on groups.io](https://groups.io/g/wtd-quorum).
We do our best to cross-post from Slack to the mailing list for archiving
purposes.

# Decision log

The following document describes the history of all governance decisions over
time, listed in descending order from newest first:


# 2020-12-11

- **Description** - We officially have enough interest to form a West Coast U.S.
  Quorum program and will launch a program later in 2021.
- **Impact** - Now participants in the Pacific and Mountain time zones can
  participate in Quorum as well.
- **Agreed to by** - West Coast US Quorum participants.
- **Source** - Proposed by West Coast US Quorum participants and agreed to in
  Slack/mailing list.


## 2020-12-05 - Coordinating on Meetup.com

- **Description** - We will have a separate parent Meetup for each quorum
  program. For example, we will have one for the U.S. East Coast and a separate
  one for future Quorum programs we run (such as the U.S. West Coast or EMEA).
  Local chapter organizers will announce upcoming events and direct their
  members to join the parent Meetup to RSVP for events.
- **Impact** - This structure will make it easier for participants who aren't a
  member of a local chapter to join in.
- **Agreed to by** - Majority of East Coast US quorum participants.
- **Source** - Proposed by Alyssa and Rose and agreed to by Write the Docs
  leadership and East Coast participants.


## 2020-11-22 - Meeting agenda

- **Description** - Our meetings will last an hour and will follow this agenda
  and time structure:

  - 7:00 to 7:10 - Social networking time
  - 7:10 to 7:15 - Announcements
  - 7:15 to 7:45 - Presentation and Q&A
  - 7:45 to 8:00 - Breakout rooms by meetup

- **Impact** - This meeting agenda will help us stay on time and help organizers
  and attendees know what time commitment to expect from a typical quorum
  meeting. We can communicate this agenda to potential speakers and attendees
  to help set expectations.
- **Agreed to by** - Majority of East Coast US quorum participants.
- **Source** - Proposed by Alyssa and agreed to in mailing list.


## 2020-11-15 - Meeting frequency and schedule

- **Description** - Our quarters will consist of the following schedule:

  | Q  | Months    |
  | -- | --------- |
  | Q1 | Feb-April |
  | Q2 | May-July  |
  | Q3 | Aug-Oct   |
  | Q4 | Nov-Jan   |

  As a general rule, meetups will occur the first month of the quarter with the
  second month of the quarter acting as a backup if needed. We'll have a
  planning meeting the last quarter of the month to plan the logistics for the
  upcoming quarter.

  We'll offer speakers Monday through Thursday as the range of acceptable days
  of the week for presentations.

  list. General meetup schedule proposed by Alyssa and agreed to on the mailing
  list.


## 2020-11-04 - Create mailing list for cross-communication

- **Description** - In addition to our Slack channel, we'll cross-post to a
  mailing list: [wtd-quorum on groups.io](https://groups.io/g/wtd-quorum)
- **Impact** - Will provide a record of our discussion for archiving purposes
  since Slack doesn't have that capability.

  meetups," we will call it "Quorum" (QRRM) for short.

- **Agreed to by** - Original East Coast US quorum participants.
- **Source** - Proposed by Rose and decided during the initial program kickoff
  meetings held on October 19 and 27. Also discussed in Slack with no

# Decision log

The following document describes the history of all governance decisions over
time, listed in descending order from newest first:


## 2020-11-22 - Meeting agenda

- **Description** - Our meetings will last an hour and will follow this agenda
  and time structure:

  - 7:00 to 7:10 - Social networking time
  - 7:10 to 7:15 - Announcements
  - 7:15 to 7:45 - Presentation and Q&A
  - 7:45 to 8:00 - Breakout rooms by meetup

- **Impact** - This meeting agenda will help us stay on time and help organizers
  and attendees know what time commitment to expect from a typical quorum
  meeting. We can communicate this agenda to potential speakers and attendees
  to help set expectations.

## 2020-11-15 - Meeting frequency and schedule

- **Description** - Our quarters will consist of the following schedule:

  | Q  | Months    |
  | -- | --------- |
  | Q1 | Feb-April |
  | Q2 | May-July  |
  | Q3 | Aug-Oct   |
  | Q4 | Nov-Jan   |

  As a general rule, meetups will occur the first month of the quarter with the
  second month of the quarter acting as a backup if needed. We'll have a
  planning meeting the last quarter of the month to plan the logistics for the
  upcoming quarter.

  We'll offer speakers Monday through Thursday as the range of acceptable days
  of the week for presentations.

  list. General meetup schedule proposed by Alyssa and agreed to on the mailing

## 2020-11-04 - Create mailing list for cross-communication

- **Description** - In addition to our Slack channel, we'll cross-post to a
  mailing list: [wtd-quorum on groups.io](https://groups.io/g/wtd-quorum)
- **Impact** - Will provide a record of our discussion for archiving purposes
  since Slack doesn't have that capability.

  meetups," we will call it "Quorum" (QRRM) for short.

  meetings held on October 19 and 27. Also discussed in Slack with no
